# Notes for 2021 STCLC bylaws sub-committee

## Introduction

On Tuesday, May 15, 1973, eight women gathered for a momentous meeting to organize a new, official library club for the
Pacific City-Woods community in south Tillamook County.
They had already been working for several years to enlist additional neighbors who shared their passion for reading
to help support their ambitious goal of providing a proper branch library service to their rural Oregon home town,
a service that would enable them to access the same book collection available halfway up the county in the main library in Tillamook.

They knew it would be tough, that they would have to follow some rules, and indeed would have to learn what those rules were.
But with 45 members and counting, there was nothing going to stop them from achieving their goal.
If they needed to read Robert's Rules of Order, then they would go get a copy of the book and read it.
If they were obligated to form a corporation to enable them to operate as a non-profit organization,
then one of them would volunteer to look into how to get that paperwork done.
And if they wanted to print membership cards, well then, someone would have to go and find out exactly how expensive that might be.

The minutes of that organizational meeting

shows a recognition that the majority of their work would continue to be fund-raising and finding more members.
And in the days before email and websites, several of them would need to get on their phones to tell existing and prospective members
when and where the next meeting would be held.
They also clearly knew that no organization would survive long without setting up their own "town law" to guide its actions,
and the brief "Synopsis of by-laws read." statement shows that someone had prepared a draft outline of town law for them to consider.

The six articles in this early draft outline

may not have been that exact synopsis that was read, but it was probably pretty close.
They may have felt like quitting when their next meeting achieved an attendance of only eight members when a quorum apparently required ten,
but they persisted in their efforts, and we have the huge advantage of standing on their shoulders as we review the bylaws of
the organization that they created nearly fifty years ago.

Our task in reviewing the STCLC bylaws would be considerably simpler if we still had only six town law articles to consider.
But the complexity that comes from adhering to governing law and planning how an organization will handle various contingencies
is one of the good kinds of complexities, one that can grow with the organization and help it handle its ups and its downs.

We may not have to spend the $16.55 that they discovered they would need for the membership cards,
but we owe it to ourselves, and arguably to them as well, to make our virtual membership cards something we can be proud to hold.

## STCLC restated and amended bylaws documents

Since 1973, at least five versions of the STCLC bylaws document have been created by similar hard-working STCLC members.

The following links provide access to the last five STCLC restated and amended bylaws documents
in non-searchable pdf format as well as searchable markdown or text formats:

The STCLC still operates per the March, 2007 bylaws, since the draft from December, 2014 has not yet been approved.
Many of its changes will be worth considering as we review what may need to be changed from the March, 2007 bylaws version.

Lists of changes in each version of the STCLC bylaws document and a list issues that motivated those changes are
[documented here](https://gist.github.com/garhanso/7795202584f9c361576bf86195365965#file-stclc-bylaws-changes.md).

As mentioned above, we know that bylaws must have been adopted back in 1973 when the STCLC was incorporated.
And a quote from pages 11 and 12 of Jackie Shank's excellent library history of STCLC
(*TODO: Add link to an online copy if possible.*) says the following:
"To be sure the Club was in compliance with regulations for non-profit organizations,
new South Tillamook County Library Club By-Laws were written, again with the help of John Giles."
This shows that the STCLC knew fully well that Oregon's laws governing non-profit corporations required some changes to existing organization's documents.
We may not need to locate the first copy, or other earlier copies of the bylaws documents,
although for completeness' sake it might be a good exercise for the sub-committee to try to track them down while we still can.

## STCLC Articles of Incorporation and Articles of Amendment documents

Four of those eight women got together again to sign and submit the original articles of incorporation on October 19, 1973,
and to assign three of themselves as the corporation's first directors.
That document was filed by the state on October 22, 1973,
making the "South Tillamook County Library Club" an official non-profit corporation.

The first page of the two-page articles of incorporation document can be retrieved from the state's
[Find a Business](https://sos.oregon.gov/business/pages/find.aspx) webpage.
If you enter either the STCLC name ("South Tillamook County Library Club") or its Registry Number ("103439-11"),
then a list will pop up with the documentation that has been submitted to the state on the corporation's behalf.
 
The STCLC board notebooks apparently contain a full copy of the articles of incorporation document,
of which the photocopy is linked above.

The search results also show that an article of amendment was submitted and filed by the state on May 9, 1989,
after it had been approved by the STCLC on May 2, 1989.
Again the webpage provides access to only the first page.
In the space under section 2's request to "State the article number(s) and set forth the article(s) as amended:"
appears the tantalizing "See Reverse" reference,
but without access to the second page we cannot tell what article(s) may have been added or modified as part of the amendment.

It is unclear whether any later amendments were ever made,
but if so they were apparently never submitted to the State of Oregon.

Because it is important that bylaws need to be consistent with the articles of incorporation,
it would be wise for us to obtain a full copy of the 1989 articles of amendment.
If we are unable to locate the full document of the document in the STCLC board notebooks or in the library,
we can invest $5.00 to obtain a **Plain Copy** of the full **Document File** from the state via the
[request for copy](https://sos.oregon.gov/business/Documents/copies-forms/301-request-for-copy.pdf) form.

## Relevant Oregon state laws

When our articles of incorporation were submitted to the state of Oregon in October, 1973,
the statutory laws for nonprofits were provided in ORS chapter 61.
The state overhauled its nonprofit corporations laws with a new act in 1989 that repealed ORS 61 and replaced it with ORS chapter 65.

Familiarizing ourselves with the current ORS 65 and the earlier ORS 61 would help us better understand the changes
that our bylaws and our articles of incorporation have already undergone.
It would also help us think more clearly about how to address the complexity of maintaining the larger bylaws document that we currently have.
We would be wise to also double-check what changes to ORS 65 have been made or proposed since the 2019 edition.

Links to current and some historical ORS 65 and ORS 61 documents can be found here:

ORS | Edition| Link(s)
:---| :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------
61  | 1971   | [(pdf)](https://archives.oregonlegislature.gov/ORS_Archives/1971-Chapter-061.pdf)

61  | 1975   | [(pdf)](https://archives.oregonlegislature.gov/ORS_Archives/1975-Chapter-061.pdf)
61  | 1987   | [(pdf)](https://archives.oregonlegislature.gov/ORS_Archives/1987-Chapter-061.pdf)
61  | 1989   | [(pdf)](https://archives.oregonlegislature.gov/ORS_Archives/1989-Chapter-061.pdf)
65  | 1989   | [(pdf)](https://archives.oregonlegislature.gov/ORS_Archives/1989-Chapter-065.pdf)
65  | 2019   | [(html)](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors065.html)

Here are just a couple of relevant references from ORS 65 and the earlier ORS 61:
* ORS 65.047 and the earlier ORS 61.311 describe Articles of Incorporation documents and what they must contain.
* ORS 65.061 and the earlier ORS 61.095 describe Bylaws documents and what they may contain.
Both clarify that the bylaws must be consistent with the articles of incorporation and law.
And ORS 65.061 in the 2019 edition clarifies that if the Bylaws are inconsistent with the Articles of Incorporation, then the latter controls.
* *TODO: Add various other key ORS 65 and ORS 61 references.*

## Relevant US federal laws

*TODO: Add brief discussion and links.*

## Objectives for the STCLC bylaws review sub-committe

*TODO: Discuss our objectives and document them here.*

Here are some initial suggestions for us to consider:
* Identify the versions of our controlling documents (articles of incorporation and bylaws) that should be taken into consideration.
* Determine what changes might be worthwhile to:
  * make our articles of incorporation more consistent with Oregon state law for nonprofit corporations,
     with federal law for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporations, and with other governing law;
  * make our bylaws more consistent with our articles of incorporation; and
  * address issues that have been raised since the current (March, 2007) bylaws were approved.
* Objectively document the issues and the relevant changes that might be made to reduce the inconsistencies (if any are found) and to address the raised issues.
* Present the sub-committee's documentation to the board and to the membership for item-by-item consideration and vote(s) to approve specific changes.
* Produce an amended draft bylaws document, and possibly an amended draft articles of incorporation document for the membership to review at one regular meeting and approve (or not) at the next regular meeting.
