# Notes for 2021 STCLC bylaws committee

## Summary of our committee's objectives

*TBD: Discuss our objectives and document them here.*

## STCLC original and amended Articles of Incorporation documents

The STCLC nonprofit was created in 1973 and its original articles of incorporation were certified on October 22, 1973.
At least one amendment was made to the articles of incorporation, and it was approved on May 2, 1989.
*TBD: It is unclear whether there were any other amendments made, but if so they were not submitted to the State of Oregon.*

The following links provide access to the two known STCLC articles of incorporation documents in markdown format:
*TBD: These documents still need to be located and documented.*

Another document titled as a "Constitution" but referring to itself as "bylaws" was apparently adopted in December, 1989.
Its content appears to be midway between articles of incorporation and bylaws, and it is unlikely (based on the dates) that it was the amended articles of incorporation.
The bylaws committee will likely need to invest $5.00 to obtain the full document file from the State of Oregon via [this link](https://sos.oregon.gov/business/Documents/copies-forms/301-request-forcopy.pdf).

The changes between the bylaws versions are [documented here](https://gist/github.com/garhanso/Z)

We may not need to locate earlier copies of the bylaws documents, although for completeness' sake it might be a good exercise for the committee.
