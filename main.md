# Notes for 2021 STCLC bylaws sub-committee

## Summary of our sub-committee's objectives

*TBD: Discuss our objectives and document them here. Here are some initial suggestions for us to consider:*
* *Identify the versions of our controlling documents (articles of incorporation and bylaws) that should be taken into consideration.*
* *Determine what changes might be worthwhile to:*
  * *make our articles of incorporation more consistent with Oregon state law for nonprofit corporations,
     with federal law for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporations, and with other governing law;
  * *make our bylaws more consistent with our articles of incorporation; and*
  * *address issues that have been raised since the current (March, 2007) bylaws were approved.*
* *Objectively document the issues and the relevant changes that might be made to reduce the inconsistencies (if any are found) and to address the raised issues.*
* *Present the sub-committee's documentation to the board and to the membership for item-by-item consideration and vote(s) to approve specific changes.*
* *Produce an amended draft bylaws document, and possibly an amended draft articles of incorporation document for the membership to review at one regular meeting and approve (or not) at the next regular meeting.

## Relevant Oregon state laws

When our articles of incorporation were submitted to the state of Oregon in October, 1973,
the statutory laws for nonprofits were provided in ORS chapter 61.
The state overhauled its nonprofit corporations laws with a new act in 1989 that repealed ORS 61 and replaced it with ORS chapter 65.

Familiarizing ourselves with the current ORS 65 and the earlier ORS 61 will help us understand what changes
our bylaws and our articles of incorporation may need, as relevant law has changed.
We would also be wise to double-check what changes have been made or proposed since the 2019 edition,
and presumably Kirk Harvey will have been presenting that kind of input to the STCLC board.

Links to current and some historical ORS 65 and ORS 61 documents can be found here:

Here are some relevant references from ORS 65 and the earlier ORS 61:
* ORS 65.047 and the earlier ORS 61.311 describe Articles of Incorporation documents and what they must contain.
* ORS 65.061 and the earlier ORS 61.095 describe Bylaws documents and what they may contain.
Both clarify that the bylaws must be consistent with the articles of incorporation and law.
And ORS 65.061 clarifies that if the Bylaws are inconsistent with the Articles of Incorporation, then the latter controls.

## Relevant US federal laws

*TBD: Add brief discussion and links...*

## STCLC Articles of Incorporation and Articles of Amendment documents

At least two relevant documents exist
per a search for business records for "South Tillamook County Library Club" or Registry Number "103439-11"
on the [Find a Business site](https://sos.oregon.gov/business/pages/find.aspx).
* The STCLC incorporators signed the original articles of incorporation on October 19, 1973,
and it was filed by the state on October 22, 1973.
The STCLC board notebooks apparently contain a copy of that document, and the search results provides access to the first of its two pages.
* The search results also show that an article of amendment was approved by the STCLC on May 2, 1989,
and it was filed by the state on May 9, 1989.
Again we have access to the first page from the web site. In the space under section 2's request to "State the article number(s) and set forth the article(s) as amended:" appears only the tantalizing "See Reverse" reference, but without the second page we cannot tell what article(s) may have been amended.
* Because it is important that bylaws need to be consistent with the articles of incorporation,
it would be wise for us to obtain a full copy of the 1989 amended articles. 
If we are unable to locate the full document of the amended version from 1989, we can invest $5.00 to obtain the full document file from
the State of Oregon via a [request for copy](https://sos.oregon.gov/business/Documents/copies-forms/301-request-for-copy.pdf).
* *TBD: It is unclear whether there were any other amendments made, but if so they were not submitted to the State of Oregon. *

## STCLC restated and amended Bylaws documents

There are at least five known versions of the STCLC Articles 
The STCLC currently operate per the March, 2007 bylaws.
A revised draft from December, 2014 was not approved.
Many of its changes will be worth considering as we review what may need to be changed from the March, 2007 bylaws version.

The following links provide access to the last five STCLC restated and amended bylaws documents in pdf and markdown formats:

The changes between the five bylaws versions are [documented here](https://gist.github.com/garhanso/7795202584f9c361576bf86195365965#file-stclc-bylaws-changes.md).

A quote from pages 11-12 of Jackie Shank's history of STCLC that says the following: "To be sure the Club was in compliance with regulations for non-profit organizations, new South Tillamook County Library Club By-Laws were written, again with the help of John Giles." This implies that at least one older bylaws document had been created, perhaps back in 1973. We may not need to locate earlier copies of the bylaws documents, although for completeness' sake it might be a good exercise for the sub-committee to track them down while we still can.
